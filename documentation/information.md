# Abstract Program representation in graphs
An abstract program (or control graph or flowchart schema) depicts the control structure of the program, leaving much of the detail to be specified in an interpretation. To put it differently, it helps to distinguish between the sequence of processing steps and the algorithms applied at each step. This allows one to change the control module, for instance by reprogramming it or by treating the abstract program as the input of a supervisor program which does not change. The supervisor executes processing steps in the sequence  specified by the abstract program whose statements are read in as the data of the supervisor.
