## • Short definition
This is an overview of abstract program concept, where visual programming can be integrated with text-based programming. I hope to be clear & brief, although there is a lot to say about each programming approach. 
Basically it is a way to represent part of the program in a graph data structure. It is an abstract program in the sense that it describes the control flow of the program, leaving much of the details of the algorithms which are applied on each step for the interpreter. In other words, it allows for splitting up the sequence of steps from the logic to be processed on each step. 
Rather than taking an entire visual programming approach, using both visual & text, allows for integration with current development tools. 
It works by providing the graph data as input to a supervisor program, in which it reads the graph, interprets it, and executes the steps in the graph on runtime during traversal. The same graph can be executed with different interpretation algorithms to match specific use-cases.

# Vision

## • Usage applicaitons: 
I've found that some program patterns are easier to grasp when displayed graphically, which assist in understanding both time and spatial relations.

- Build pipelines
- Sever middleware. 
- Routing with logical conditions. 
- Template compositions and rendering.

## • Steps to integrate into current deployment lifecycle / development workflow.

## • Pros & Cons.
